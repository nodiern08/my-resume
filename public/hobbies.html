    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

    <p>I'll get straight to the point. My hobbies consist of 3 things;
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Gaming</li></h3>
                <p>
                    I grew up playing video games my whole life. The first video game I ever played was Super Mario on my sister's Super Nintendo.<br> 
                    But I didn't play it all that much; my sisters were better than me at it anyway. My first game console was the original GameBoy.<br> 
                    You know, the one that's the size of a brick and could survive a drop from a 10-story building? That one. It was great! I played<br>
                    Pokemon Red and got my Kadabra to level 100 before I knew it could evolve to Alakazam through a trade with a friend.

                <p>
                    Throughout my life, I owned other consoles like the Nintendo 64, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, 4, and 5.<br> 
                    I loved the Zelda games, Ocarina of Time was my favorite out of the series. I'm also a Pokemon fan; Gotta Catch 'em All, am I right?<br> 
                    I've played nearly all of them. However, most of my gaming career was on the PC when my parents bought my first computer.<br> 
                    I was really addicted to MMOs like Runescape and World of Warcraft. I must admit, I still play Runescape (Old School version) to this day,<br> 
                    even though it's a 20-year-old computer game. Other than Runescape, I love Rocket League. It's so fun, challenging, and technical,<br> 
                    and did I mention it's really fun? I'll leave a shameless plug in here and drop my Old School Runescape username for anyone who plays<br> 
                    to check out my stats on the high scores. I'm proud of my account! Heck, add me while you're at it! OSRS username: Imago Rei

            <h3><li>Drawing/Painting</li></h3>
            <p>
                If I wasn't playing video games, I was drawing. I loved drawing my favorite anime and video game characters growing up.<br> 
                It was a way to express myself and relieve the stress of school and some gaming frustrations. At some point, I fell off from this hobby;<br> 
                in my 20s, most of my time was spent on work, gaming, and my relationship. It wasn't until I met my co-worker, Jonathan, from Road America,<br> 
                that my love for Art reignited. He was talented and produced fantastic work. He inspired me, and a fire sparked inside me to pick up the pencil again.<br> 
                Albeit I was rusty and nothing I produced ever came close to his work, I kept going. I practiced drawing cars at first, then eventually, people,<br> 
                portraits, and animals. This passion for Art is what eventually led me here today.

            <h3><li>Playing Music</li></h3>
            <p>
                My mother forced me to play the Piano when I was in the 6th grade. I hated it.<br> 
                She hired a tutor, and for a whole year, I was forced to learn and play the instrument every weekend, which was awful. But you know what? I'm glad I did.<br> 
                I appreciate what my mother did for me, I just didn't know it then, but after I quit the Piano after a year of lessons, I returned to it and fell in love.<br> 
                I played the Piano for years, and I was getting good at it. Then in high school, I picked up the guitar and learned to play a variety of styles, like Classical<br> 
                on the acoustic and Metal on the electric. Unfortunately, I don't play the Piano anymore. I just don't have one! But I still pick up the guitar here and there<br> 
                and play my favorite song, Endlessly, from my favorite band, Muse.
