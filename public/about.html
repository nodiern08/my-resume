<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  Here's a little something about me.<br>
<br>
  My name is Nodier (and that's pronounced "No-dee-A"). I was born<br>
  and raised in Miami, FL's hot, sunny city. I am primarily Hispanic, as<br>
  my parents are Cuban, but my father's family comes of French descent.<br>
  So you can probably guess where the name comes from.
</p>

<p>
  I grew up like most kids in the 90s; go outside and play with their<br> 
  friends, then go back inside and play some video games and draw<br>
  pictures when I felt inspired. But I wasn't a techy kid until I reached my<br>
  early teen years when I had my first computer and started playing<br>
  computer games. Mainly MMOs like Runescape and World of Warcraft.<br>
  The good ol' days!
</p>

<p>
  I'd explore the computer and try to understand the software. Click on<br>
  things and see where it would take me. I once opened my dad's<br>
  computer out of curiosity. I took it apart piece by piece, remembering<br>
  the order I removed its parts, then reassembled the computer back together<br>  
  and felt like a total badass.
</p>

<p>
  I did have an artistic side; I loved to draw and create characters inspired<br>
  by my favorite anime and video game characters. It was all just a glorified hobby.<br>
  But as I got older and worked at some terrible jobs, I later realized that my career<br>
  was unfulfilling, and I felt something was missing. It took many years to realize<br>
  I needed to pursue a career that wasn't just fulfilling but more "me."  
</p>

<p>
  So I changed career paths and pursued an artistic career. I studied traditional<br>
  and digital art, then learned to program, starting with Python, and earned some<br>
  certifications, including the PCEP.
</p>

<p>
  Programming is an art within itself. There's something beautiful about code.<br>
  Watching your program come together is like seeing a painting come to life<br>
  as the picture develops after every stroke.
